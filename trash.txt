We would like to inform you that we are in the process of migrating our server infrastructure from Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 to version 8.x. This decision stems from the end of support for RHEL 7 and the necessity to ensure continued security and stability for our systems.In addition to the server migration, we are also planning to upgrade our Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) from the current version 2.7 to the latest version 3.x. This upgrade is crucial for maintaining compatibility with evolving security standards and enhancing our network infrastructure.To ensure a smooth transition, we are implementing a parallel setup. While conducting the server migration and Cisco ISE upgrade, the current environment will remain operational to prevent any authentication issues or disruptions to our services.We kindly request your support in this endeavor by providing the necessary resources, specifically a virtual server on RHEL 8, to facilitate the migration process effectively.Your cooperation and assistance in this matter are greatly appreciated. Should you have any questions or concerns, please do not hesitate to reach out to us.Thank you for your attention to this matter.
